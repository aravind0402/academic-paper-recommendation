 - Built a content based recommendation system.
 - Work on a hybrid approach using topic modelling and content of the papers.
 - use authors and topic modelling scores to recommend papers.
 - extract text based features.
 - extract graph based features.
 - concatenate both these features within the LDA identified groups.
 - use kmeans to identify the potential similar papers nearby.
